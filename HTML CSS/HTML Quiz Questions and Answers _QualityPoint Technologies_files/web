So, I thought of moving the web page files from Net4In\u0026nbsp; to Bluehost server while still keeping the domain with net4in. That time, I came to know about some negative review comments about Net4India. I am not sure whether they are valid or not. Anyway, I have decided to move the domain from Net4India to GoDaddy so that I can easily manage this domain along with our other domains.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESo, I logged into my Godaddy account and initiated domain transfer process, by making payment for the domain transfer. Initially I thought I need not make any payment for transferring domain as I already renewed it from net4india itself. Anyway, domain transfer payment extended the domain life one more year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EPreviously I did lot of domain transfers. But all of them were within GoDaddy only. i-e just domain pushing or change of account which is very easy process. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAfter completing the domain Transfer Payment, GoDaddy sent me \u003Ci\u003ETransaction ID\u003C\/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003ESecurity Code\u003C\/i\u003E which are required for entering \u003Cb\u003EAuthCode\u003C\/b\u003E for Domain transfer.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI loggedin to my Net4India panel and generated AuthCode for the Domain, and entered it in GoDaddy Panel to initiate the Domain Transfer. I thought this transfer will be done in few hours. But GoDaddy status was saying that it is waiting for the approval from the Domain Sender and it will take around 7 days.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI contacted Net4india support thro' their support ticket system to make sure that the domain is unlocked for enabling transfer.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI was very much concerned about avoiding any down time during this domain transfer process. Because this blog has started  recovering from some Google search issues in past few days. I don't want this recovery process getting affected by downtime.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESo, I wanted to add the CNAME records for this Blogger blog from GoDaddy so that we can avoid any downtime for this blog. But, I came to know that we can not do the DNS settings for the \"transferring domain\". It seems we can do the DNS settings from GoDaddy\u0026nbsp; only after the domain got transferred successfully.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETo handle this issue, I added this domain as addon domain from Bluehost control panel, and added all the required CNAME records for this blog. And, I copied all the webpages files of qualitypointtech.com site to Bluehost thro' ftp.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003Ei-e My plan is, qualitypointtech.com will be hosted in Bluehost ,  blog.qualitypointtech.com  will be hosted with Google Blogger, and CNAME records for the blog will be kept with Bluehost. \u003Cbr \/\u003EEverything looks good. Only thing is, I need to add the Name Servers (NS) of blue host with the domain provider. Since adding NS records in Godaddy before completing the domain transfer is not possible, I decided to replace the net4india Name Servers with Bluehost name servers from Net4India control panel itself. But I couldn't do it. It seems after initiating domain transfer process we can not make any changes from current domain provider also.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBecause of these limitations, I expected some downtime during this transfer, and I thought I need to immediately put the BlueHost Name Servers from GoDaddy once after the completion of domain transfer.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EToday I got email from Godaddy about the successful completion of the domain transfer. Surprisingly there is no downtime for both website and blog. Because domain got transferred with all the DNS settings. So, everything was working fine (with old settings).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThen, I replaced the net4india name servers with Bluehost name servers from GoDaddy control panel. For few minutes I kept name servers of both net4india and bluehost to handle the DNS propagation delay. After that I removed the Net4india Name servers. Now the site is getting loaded from bluehost, and I am seeing significant improvement in page loading speed. And, blog is loaded from Google server while DNS resolving will be done by both GoDaddy and Bluehost.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELet me know if you face any difficulty in accessing our site and blog.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EPersonally, I like Net4India, irrespective of their poor customer support, loading speed issues and slightly high price. Because, Net4India has taken initiative to start the web business in India at the time when the multi national hosting companies are not focusing on their business in India. Net4India will be helpful for Indian users by accepting cheque while other hosting companies and domain providers need paypal or creditcard.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAnd, I came to know that Net4India is having data centers in India. So, we can give preference to Net4India hosting if our target audience are available in India.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAnyway, right now I have to make this decision of moving away from net4india as our Target audience are outside India.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHave you done any Domain transfer previously?

Although the content the site provides is the motivating contributor to this fact, other developments within its pages are what keep those visitors coming back. Everything from colors to images can make or break a website. While this may seem overwhelming at first, it's actually not too difficult to keep it simple, tasteful, and attractive.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1. Legible\u003C\/b\u003E - Your website should always practice the best legibility possible. It is the content that will drive visitors to your site whether it is through a search term or a direct link. Don't hide your content by adding too many images, banners, or advertisements of various kinds. You don't want to confuse the reader by making the content too hard to read.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. Fact-based \u003C\/b\u003E- Always base your content on what is true and not surrounded by conspiracy theories. Unless the purpose of your site is to perpetuate these theories, most visitors want to be informed with actual knowledge. Being able to cite your content's basis can go a long way to developing a reputation for dependable information.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E3. Colors and Design\u003C\/b\u003E- There are many ways you can spruce up the website to make it more attractive to visitors. The correct color variations for the site can make a pleasing impression on the visitor. However, too many contrasting colors or loud flashing objects could make for a terrible experience for the visitor and they may never return. Keep your color schemes and gradients logical. If you are unsure about how to coordinate colors, take a look at other websites and see what kinds of color schemes they are using.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E4. Images\u003C\/b\u003E - You don't want to use more than one or two images per page of content. Unless you are developing a how-to page or otherwise need visual aids, it could distract from the content. You want your images to be relevant to your content as well. Writing a page about baby clothes and showing an image of a golden retriever doesn't make much sense, unless you're putting the clothes on the golden retriever.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E5. Add-ons\u003C\/b\u003E - Installing a few add-ons to your website can seem like a way to make it more fun, but it could be detrimental to the development of your website. Sites that look \"too busy\" don't perform well with the average web-surfer. Don't be afraid try out a few of these additions, just try to keep your site from looking like the want ads in the newspaper.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E6. Mobility \u003C\/b\u003E- As many mobile devices are taking to the Internet, developing a website that can provide a pleasurable experience to the owners of these devices can help keep them coming back for more. While it may be next to impossible to please 100% of the people 100% of the time, you can still gain the support of the majority of your visitors. Keep an eye on the analytical data of your website in order to develop a look and feel tailored to that majority. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAn attractive website doesn't mean it has to be loaded with images, banners, or other diversions. As long as the visitor can find the content he or she needs, it's a step in the right direction. Some additions may be fun and unique, but too many of them can take away from the website's primary goal.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAuthor Bio:\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EJack Meyers\u003C\/b\u003E is a regular contributor for \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.nannybackgroundcheck.com\/\"\u003Ewww.nannybackgroundcheck.com\u003C\/a\u003E.

We need not do anything for making it work. Just we have to install the wordpress plug-in WPTouch and activate it after enabling it in Cache plugin also.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIt will automatically detect various mobile devices and will apply mobile friedly theme on them. The web version of the site will NOT be affected in any way. And, the default mobile theme was looking good.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBut I had to immediately deactivate this plugin as many pages were not loading on mobile devices. Because we used custom php coding in those pages. Anyway this plugin-in will be good option if you are using simple wordpress site without any custom php coding.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESo, I am looking for other options to make our quotes site mobile friendly. Time being, I have decided to improve the page loading speed of TheQuotes.Net so that the same web theme can load fast in mobile also. It will help to improve the SEO also as Google is giving more importance for \"page loading speed\" while deciding SERP rank for any website.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs a first step to improve the page loading speed, I removed the facebook like box, as it took more time to load. And, I believe it won't affect the \u003Cb\u003E'Facebook likes' \u003C\/b\u003Eas my previous study shows that people are NOT liking the facebook page from the quotes website. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs suggested by many performance measuring tools, I updated the code to load the jquery js files from Google servers instead of loading them from our own server.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAnd,  I installed \u003Cb\u003EWP Minify\u003C\/b\u003E wordpress plugin for compressing and combining CSS style files and multiple javascript files. CSS was working fine after activating Minify plugin, but js files gave error. So, I used the \u003Cb\u003EWPMinify \u003C\/b\u003Eplugin only for compressing HTML content and for compressing\/combining css files. For javascript files, I used the Minify option offline and included the compressed\/combined file manually. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAfter doing these changes, the page loading speed of \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/thequotes.net\/\"\u003ETheQuotes.Net\u003C\/a\u003E was improved significantly, and I am still looking for various options to improve the performance. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EYou can \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qualitypoint.blogspot.com\/2010\/10\/free-email-subscription-for-getting-our.html\"\u003Esubscribe to our Email posts\u003C\/a\u003E, and you can \u003Ca href=\"javascript:addToFavorites()\"\u003Ebookmark\u003C\/a\u003E this blog for further reading, or you can subscribe to our \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds2.feedburner.com\/QualitypointTechnologies\"\u003Eblog feed\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003Cdiv class=\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qualitypointtech.net\/forum\/\"\u003EForum Discussions...\u003C\/a\u003E | \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.thequotes.net\/\"\u003EMotivational Quotes\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blog.qualitypointtech.com\/feeds\/4006190262276313927\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/comment.g?blogID=4410551344051995799\u0026postID=4006190262276313927","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/4410551344051995799\/posts\/default\/4006190262276313927"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/4410551344051995799\/posts\/default\/4006190262276313927"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/www.blog.qualitypointtech.com\/2012\/09\/improved-page-loading-speed-of.html","title":"Improved the Page loading speed of TheQuotes.Net"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Rajamanickam Antonimuthu"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/113752109835263340956"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/-3L_W-_ayMQI\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAACVo\/NmZDZxTXxDo\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4410551344051995799.post-7816313563184647867"},"published":{"$t":"2012-09-12T01:37:00.003-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2012-09-12T01:37:53.612-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"News"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"web"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"  GoDaddy says that the crash was due to internal network issue."},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe popular domain registrar and the web hosting site GoDaddy.com and millions of their customer websites were went down on September 10th.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EPreviously a person claiming as member of the hackers Group \"\u003Cb\u003EAnonymous\u003C\/b\u003E\" took responsibility for bringing Godaddy sites down.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ENow, Godaddy has informed that the service outage was due to a series of internal network issue.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EGoDaddy CEO \u003Cb\u003E\"Scott Wagner\" \u003C\/b\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/support.godaddy.com\/godaddy\/ceo-addresses-sept-10-service-outage\/\"\u003Ehas published \u003C\/a\u003Ebelow message.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\"tr_bq\"\u003EThe service outage was due to a series of internal network events  that corrupted router data tables.
